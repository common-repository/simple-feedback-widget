Simple Feedback Widget - simply add this little widget to your Wordpress site and collect feedback and capture insights.

== Description ==
Simply add this little widget to your Wordpress site to ask a question and start capturing feedback.

Simple Feedback Widget - so simple it hurts!

We obsessed about creating the best User Experience we could think of. For your users and yourself.
Ask one question which your site visitors can respond to and let you know what they think. It takes a few seconds to setup and try, we are certain you will understand it straight away.

Powered by rekommend.io

== Installation ==
Dead easy install 1,2,3:

1. Activate it

2. Use the default question "Would you recommend this site" or update it to something more appropriate to you

3. Done

Yes, Done!!

Responses are sent to your inbox (to the WP admin email).

Go to the Settings --> Simple Feedback Widget area to update your question or the position of the widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Where can I put the widget?

By default we have two options, bottom left and bottom right. You can also set the margin from the side (in pixel). If you want to do anything more, you are free to edit the CSS files of course. And let us know if you have a request or comment.

What happens if a user clicks on the red (x) next to the question?

The question is then hidden for 7 days. We do this by setting a cookie so if you are testing it and accidentally dismissed the question you can delete that cookie.

How can I look at the responses?

You get notified by email when a response came through. As we are using rekommend.io as the backend we can create reports for automatically. You will need to create an account on rekommend.io though.

Is this plugin always free?

Yes, this WP plugin is free forever. We make money off our related project (which you should check out: http://www.rekommend.io) but we created this plugin to give back to the community and also to thank Wordpress.

Are there any limits to the amount of feedback I can get?

No limits, in fact, we encourage you to collect as much feedback as you can. It's really important to ask for feedback in a User friendly fashion.
